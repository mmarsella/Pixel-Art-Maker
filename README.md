# Pixel-Art-Maker
Make your own pixel art!


This project is coded mostly in javascript.  

It is a series of divs with a color pallete on the last row.  Clicking on a color pallete will change the brush color 
and selecting any div above the pallete will change its color.

Features to add:

1)  Ability to save pixel art
2)  Add the ability to click and drag to paint multiple pixels at once
3)  Add a paintbucket tool which allows a user to drag a box across the screen and paint all pixels that fall inside that box
4)  Re-clicking a pixel that is already colored will revert it back to white.
